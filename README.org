** Requirements

- SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp)
- Quicklisp
- ncurses development libraries
- curl (for ~/crafterbin~ uploads)
- One of the following for clipboard support (optional):
  - =xclip= (X11)
  - =xsel= (X11)
  - =wl-clipboard= (Wayland)

** Installation

#+begin_src bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CLatter.git
cd CLatter

# Build
make clean && make
#+end_src

** Usage

#+begin_src bash
./clatter
#+end_src

On first run, you'll be prompted for a nickname and connected to Libera.Chat.

*** Quick Start

1. Launch CLatter: =./clatter=
2. Join a channel: =/join #channel=
3. Send messages: Just type and press Enter
4. Switch buffers: =Ctrl-P= (previous) / =Ctrl-N= (next)
5. Scroll history: =Ctrl-U= / =Ctrl-D=
6. Tab-complete nicks: Start typing a nick and press =Tab=
7. Quit: =/q= or =F10=

*** Tips

- If the display looks corrupted, press =Ctrl-L= to refresh
- Use =Ctrl-W= to toggle split-pane view for monitoring two channels
- Messages mentioning your nick are highlighted
- Logs are saved to =~/.local/share/clatter/logs/=

** Configuration

Configuration is stored in =~/.config/clatter/config.lisp=

Example:
#+begin_src lisp
(:clatter-config
 :version 1
 :default-network nil
 :networks
 ((:name "libera"
   :server "irc.libera.chat"
   :port 6697
   :tls t
   :nick "yournick"
   :username nil
   :realname "Your Name"
   :password nil
   :nickserv-pw "your-password"
   :sasl :plain
   :autojoin ("#lisp" "#emacs")
   :autoconnect t)))
#+end_src

*** SASL Authentication

SASL authenticates you *before* your connection is visible, so your IP/hostname is cloaked from the start. To enable SASL:

1. You must have a registered nick with NickServ
2. Add =:sasl :plain= to your network config
3. Ensure =:nickserv-pw= contains your NickServ password (or use =:authinfo=)

*** Authinfo Password Storage

Instead of storing passwords in =config.lisp=, you can use =~/.authinfo= or =~/.authinfo.gpg= (encrypted with GPG). Set =:nickserv-pw :authinfo= in your config:

#+begin_src lisp
(:name "libera"
 :server "irc.libera.chat"
 :nick "yournick"
 :nickserv-pw :authinfo
 :sasl :plain
 ...)
#+end_src

Then add an entry to your =~/.authinfo.gpg= file:
#+begin_example
machine irc.libera.chat login yournick password your-secret-password
#+end_example

CLatter will decrypt the file using GPG and look up the password by matching the server and nick.

** CrafterBin Integration

CLatter includes built-in support for uploading files to [[https://crafterbin.glennstack.dev][CrafterBin]], a simple pastebin service.

#+begin_src
/crafterbin /path/to/file.txt
#+end_src

This will:
1. Upload the file to CrafterBin
2. Copy the resulting URL to your clipboard (requires =xclip=, =xsel=, or =wl-copy=)
3. Display the URL in the chat buffer

Useful for quickly sharing code snippets, logs, or configuration files in IRC channels.
